    <p>I love to play videogames, especially the ones I grew up playing. I used to spend all my hours watching minecraft videos and playing street fighter.</p>
    <p>Nothing can really compare to the experience I had when I was younger when it came to videogames, I just started to love playing them from the start.</p>
    <p>If you were to ask me to play a videogame with you, even if I've never played it before, I will happily join in the fun</p>
    <p>Theres still a countless number of titles I have yet to play and I find it amazing how this form of entertainment can bring about so many different communities.</p>

    <p>Here we have one of my favorite modpacks available that I actually still play in Minecraft and the main fighter I use whenever I play Street Fighter, his name being Akuma</p>
